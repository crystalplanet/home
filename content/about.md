Hi! My name is **Kuba Birecki** and I'm a **software engineer**, **writer** and a **world citizen**.  
**\#crystalplanet** is my very own little place in the vastness of the internet.

I've been programming professionaly for the last three years, but I have written code as a hobby for over a decade.  
**I specialize in web development and rapidly bringing ideas to life**.

**I'm an advocate of change** and promote bold ideas. I constantly get out of my comfort zone and I encourage others to do the same, as I think it's the only way to ever move forward.

So far, I've had the pleasure to work for the world's largest social-learning network - **Brainly** - and one of Krak√≥w's fastest growing software companies - **Codete**.  
I consider myself a true full-stack engineer, having done extensive work on both front- and back-end, some light server administration, and I've even been a QA Engineer. I am not afraid to get my hands dirty with some design or UX work as well.  
**I believe my job is about creating great products and user experiences, rather than just spitting out code**.

As far as the actual code is concerned, **Clojure** - [the language in which this website is written](https://github.com/crystalplanet/home) - is my weapon of choice. I've also done a fair bit of development using **JavaScript** and **PHP**.
