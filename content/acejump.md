AceJump is a Sublime Text 3 plugin, enabling easy movement between characters and lines in the open window. It is based on [an emacs mode with the same name](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/AceJump). AceJump for emacs proved crazy helpful for me and I decided to bring some of its goodness back to Sublime Text.

The plugin is available on [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/AceJump) and has accumulated over 5000 downloads so far.  
The source code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/ice9js/ace-jump-sublime).
