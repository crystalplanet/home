Brainly is the world's largest **social-learning network**. During my time at the company, Brainly consisted of 19 websites in a variety of languages, hitting **40M monthly unique users**.

As a **QA Engineer**, my job was to maintain our **selenium** test suite. I managed to completely rewrite the existing codebase and quadruple the performance. While being part of Brainly's core team, I also worked with our technical teams to introduce **continuous integration & delivery**, **TDD** and **BDD**.
